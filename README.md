# Injector Templates
Injector templates made in Winforms that anyone can use. All templates use a NuGet lib called [Guna](https://gunaui.com/) for the UI elements and [Costura.Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Costura) to bundle all the DLL files into the built exe. Some may also use [dot-net-transitions](https://github.com/UweKeim/dot-net-transitions) for smooth animations. If you decide to use a template please add credits to my github.

## How To Use
Simply download the repo and open the solution of the template you want to use. If the application does not run then you're either missing a DLL or don't have the latest [Dotnet Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) installed.
